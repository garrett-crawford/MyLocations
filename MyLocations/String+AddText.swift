    // when a method changes the value of a struct, it must be marked as mutating
    // String is a struct, which is a value type (can't be modified when declared with let)
    // mutating tells Swift that addText(withSeparator) can only be used on strings that are made with var,
    // but not strings made with let
    // don't need to use mutating with methods inside a class because classes are reference types
    // also an example of a default parameter (allows caller to leave out this parameter when calling the method)
